# Resource Comparison Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comparison between current DeploymentConfig resources and generated Deployment resources for prod and test environments.

## Prod Environment

### Status: ✅ **REPLICAS MATCH - READY FOR MIGRATION**

All services now have matching replica counts between DeploymentConfigs and Deployments.

### Perfect Matches (4 services)

- ✅ **corenlp** - All resources match perfectly
- ✅ **nlp-service** - All resources match (replicas: 0)
- ✅ **extract-quotes-service** - All resources match (replicas: 3)
- ✅ **editor** - All resources match (replicas: 3)

### Replicas Match, Minor Resource Differences (16 services)

These services have correct replica counts but some resource limits differ from prod. The differences are acceptable as they're mostly where prod has no limits set and deployments have conservative limits.

| Service                       | Replicas | Notes                                                  |

### Failed to Generate (1 service)

- ❌ **extract-quotes-service** - Missing secret file (llm-api-keys.env)

### Actions Needed for Test

1. ⚠️ Update api-services test overlay to set replicas: 2 and add limits
2. ⚠️ Update charts-api test overlay to set replicas: 1 and adjust resources
3. ⚠️ Create placeholder for extract-quotes-service llm-api-keys.env in test
4. ⚠️ Optionally adjust resource limits for the 5 other services (minor differences)

## Dev Environment

### Status: ✅ **ALREADY MIGRATED AND RUNNING**

Dev environment has been successfully migrated to Deployments and is running in production.

### Lessons Learned from Dev

1. ✅ Oracle service not deployed in dev (commented out in scripts)
2. ✅ Service count: 25 services (26 total - oracle)
3. ✅ `getPods` function returns "0" for empty results
4. ✅ Deployment YAMLs exclude secrets, routes, and PVCs (managed separately)
5. ✅ Migration scripts create backups before applying changes

## Summary

| Environment | Status      | Services Ready       | Action Required                 |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Dev**     | ✅ Migrated | 25/25                | None - Running successfully     |
| **Test**    | ⚠️ Ready    | 12/20 perfect        | Minor adjustments to 7 services |
| **Prod**    | ✅ Ready    | 20/20 replicas match | Extract secrets, then migrate   |

**Overall Status: READY FOR PROD MIGRATION** 🚀

All critical replica counts match, resource limits are acceptable (mostly conservative), and all necessary scripts and backups are in place.

# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html

network:
  host: ${NETWORK_HOST}

cluster:
  name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}
  # initial_master_nodes: ${CLUSTER_INITIAL_MASTER_NODES}

node:
  name: ${NODE_NAME}
#
# Add custom attributes to the node:
#node.attr.rack: r1
#
# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
#
path:
  # Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):
  data: /usr/share/elasticsearch/data
  # Path to log files:
  # logs: /var/log/elasticsearch
#
# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
#
# Lock the memory on startup:
#
bootstrap:
  memory_lock: ${BOOTSTRAP_MEMORY_LOCK}
#
# Make sure that the heap size is set to about half the memory available
# on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this
# limit.
#
# Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# Set the bind address to a specific IP (IPv4 or IPv6):
#
#network.host: 192.168.0.1
#
# Set a custom port for HTTP:
#
http:
  port: 9200
  cors:
    allow-origin: http://localhost:40005,http://127.0.0.1:40005,https://opensource.appbase.io
    enabled: true
    allow-headers: X-Requested-With,X-Auth-Token,Content-Type,Content-Length,Authorization,x-search-query,x-search-state,x-search-filters
    allow-credentials: true

#
# For more information, consult the network module documentation.
#
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
discovery:
  type: ${DISCOVERY_TYPE}
  seed_hosts: ${DISCOVERY_SEED_HOSTS}
  seed_providers: ${DISCOVERY_SEED_PROVIDERS}
# Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when new node is started:
# The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
#
#discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["host1", "host2"]
#
# Prevent the "split brain" by configuring the majority of nodes (total number of master-eligible nodes / 2 + 1):
#
#discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes:
#
# For more information, consult the zen discovery module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Gateway -----------------------------------
#
# Block initial recovery after a full cluster restart until N nodes are started:
#
#gateway.recover_after_nodes: 3
#
# For more information, consult the gateway module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Various -----------------------------------
#
# Require explicit names when deleting indices:
#
#action.destructive_requires_name: true

Task: Extract all direct quotes from the provided text.
Identify the speaker for each quote. Use 'Unknown' if the speaker is not explicitly mentioned.

Existing Quotes (DO NOT include these or similar quotes in your response):
----------
{ExistingQuotes}
----------

Input Text:
----------
{InputText}
----------

Output Format: Return the result strictly in the following JSON format. Ensure the entire output is valid JSON according to RFC 8259.
```json
{
  "quotes": [
    {
      "id": 1, // Sequential integer ID for each quote
      "text": "The exact quote text, including surrounding quotation marks if present in the original text.",
      "canonicalSpeaker": "The identified speaker's name (or 'Unknown')",
      "beginSentence": 0 // Placeholder, can be always 0
    }
    // ... more quote objects
  ]
}
```

CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING RULES (Strict adherence required):
1.  The entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object.
2.  JSON Strings (values for "text" and "canonicalSpeaker"):
    *   ONLY escape double quotes (") as \" and backslashes (\) as \\.
    *   DO NOT escape single quotes ('). For example, 'it's' must appear as "it's" in the JSON string, NOT "it\'s". The sequence \' is INVALID in standard JSON strings.
    *   Preserve all original punctuation and capitalization within the quote text.
3.  Do not include trailing commas in JSON arrays or objects.
4.  Use only double quotes (") for all JSON keys and string values.
5.  If no quotes are found in the text, return an empty array like this: { "quotes": [] }.
6.  Ensure if you find a speaker has full name, always keep using the speaker's full name.
7.  If you found a speaker's quote is similar to an existing quote, do not include it in the response.
8.  If you found a quote with unknown speaker, go check the text before and after the quote to see if you can find the speaker's name.
9.  Be consistent with ending punctuation - don't add or remove periods, commas, etc. at the end of quotes.
10. Consider quotes that differ only in trailing punctuation as the same quote and choose the most complete version.
